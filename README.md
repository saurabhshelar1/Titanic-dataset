### EDA on Titanic dataset and making a predictive model which can predict if a passenger can survive or not.
I've used this famouse Titanic dataset and performed Exploratory Data Analysis to get some insights and found some intersting things which might be the reason of survival of  passengers back then.You'll get to see it in the file 'Titanic_data_EDA_and_Model'. There is PPT in which you'll get to see the isights of EDA. Then I build a model with an accuracy of 87.71% which can help you predict if a passenger with certain charesteristics can survive or not.
