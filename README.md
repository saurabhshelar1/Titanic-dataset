# Titanic-dataset
### EDA on Titanic dataset and making a predictive model which can predict if a passenger can survive or not.
I've used this famous Titanic dataset and performed Exploratory Data Analysis to get some insights and found some interesting things that might be the reason for the survival of  passengers back then. You'll get to see it in the file 'Titanic_data_EDA_and_Model'. There is a PPT in which you'll get to see the insights of EDA. Then I build a model with an accuracy of 87.71% which can help you predict if a passenger with certain characteristics can survive or not.
